We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party service providers.

**3. Data Storage and Security**

Personal data stored by the App is retained locally on your device. We do not have access to this data unless you explicitly share it with us (e.g., through error reports).

**3.2. Security Measures**

We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we implement reasonable security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**3.3. Your Responsibility**

You are responsible for:
- Maintaining the security of your device

These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

**5. Links to Other Sites**

The App may contain links to external websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
